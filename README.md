# GeoHuntsville 2017 Exercise and Demo

The 2017 demo is about active shooters inside the Von Braun Center. First responders chase the perpetrators inside and outside the buildings, while protecting a VIP. Several bags containing explosives are dropped while the chase takes place. This involves various assets:

- Security sensors inside the buildings
- Video cameras inside and outside the building
- Tracking system for the VIP
- Mobile phones used as body cams by first responders (video, location and orientation)
- Several types of UAVs with video

Many of these assets can be visualized and controlled thanks to OpenSensorHub
